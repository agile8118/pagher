      <h3 class="heading-tertiary margin-bottom-1 margin-top-3">2. Use License</h3>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on
          Pagher's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a
          transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
          <ol type="i">
            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
            </li>
            <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Pagher's website;</li>
            <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
            <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
          Pagher at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license,
          you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</li>
      </ol>

          warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
          intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>
        <li>Further, Pagher does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or

      <p class="normal-paragraph margin-bottom-2">In no event shall Pagher or its suppliers be liable for any damages
        (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out
        of the use or inability to use the materials on Pagher's website, even if Pagher or a Pagher authorized
        representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some
        jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
        incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

        accurate, complete or current. Pagher may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time
        without notice. However Pagher does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>
      <h3 class="heading-tertiary margin-bottom-1 margin-top-3">6. Links</h3>
      <p class="normal-paragraph margin-bottom-2">Pagher has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is
        not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement
        by Pagher of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>
